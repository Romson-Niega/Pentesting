# Introduction
The purpose of this engagement was to assess the networks’ and systems’ security and identify potential security flaws by 
utilizing industry-accepted testing methodology and best practices. 
The project was conducted on a number of systems on company’s network segments by pentester Romson.

Focused on the following:

●	Attempting to determine what system-level vulnerabilities could be discovered and exploited with no prior knowledge of the environment 
or notification to administrators.

●	Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities found and access confidential information that may be stored on systems.

●	Documenting and reporting on all findings.

Methodology:

● Reconnaissance 
Pentester begins assessments by checking for any passive (open source) data that may assist the assessors with their tasks. 

● Identification of Vulnerabilities and Services
Pentester uses private, and public tools such as Metasploit, Hashcat, and Nmap to gain a perspective of network security from a 
hacker’s point of view. 
These methods provide company with an understanding of the risks that threaten its information, and also the strengths and weaknesses of the 
current controls protecting those systems. 

● Vulnerability Exploitation
Pentester’s normal process is to both manually test each identified vulnerability and use automated tools to exploit these issues. 
Exploitation of a vulnerability is defined as any action we perform that gives us unauthorized access to the system or sensitive data. 

● Reporting
Once exploitation is completed and the assessors have completed their objectives,  
the assessment team writes the report, which is the final deliverable to the customer.

Conclusion:

● This assessment was conducted to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the 
vulnerabilities to provide a greater level of security for the environment.
