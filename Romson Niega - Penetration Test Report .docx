For the testing, focused on the following:

●	Attempting to determine what system-level vulnerabilities could be discovered and exploited with no prior knowledge of the environment or notification to administrators.
●	Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities found and access confidential information that may be stored on systems.
●	Documenting and reporting on all findings.

This assessment was conducted to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities to provide a greater level of security for the environment.

Penetration Testing Methodology:

Reconnaissance 
Pentester begins assessments by checking for any passive (open source) data that may assist the assessors with their tasks. 
If internal, the assessment team will perform active recon using tools such as Nmap.

Identification of Vulnerabilities and Services
Pentester uses custom, private, and public tools such as Metasploit, Hashcat, and Nmap to gain a perspective of network security from a hacker’s point of view. 
These methods provide company with an understanding of the risks that threaten its information, and also the strengths and weaknesses of the current controls protecting those systems. 
The results were achieved by mapping the network architecture, identifying hosts and services, enumerating network and system-level vulnerabilities, attempting to discover unexpected hosts within the environment, and eliminating false positives that might have arisen from scanning. 

Vulnerability Exploitation
Pentester’s normal process is to both manually test each identified vulnerability and use automated tools to exploit these issues. 
Exploitation of a vulnerability is defined as any action we perform that gives us unauthorized access to the system or sensitive data. 

Reporting
Once exploitation is completed and the assessors have completed their objectives, or have done everything possible within the allotted time, the assessment team writes the report, which is the final deliverable to the customer.
